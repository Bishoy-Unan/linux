When you move the file.c to the /usr/local/bin directory in Ubuntu, it becomes executable from any location because /usr/local/bin is in the system's PATH environment variable.

The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories where the system looks for executable files when a command is entered. When you move the file.c to /usr/local/bin, it is included in the PATH, allowing it to be executed from any location without specifying its full path.

So, when you type the filename in the terminal, the system will search for it in all directories listed in the PATH, and if it finds a matching executable file in /usr/local/bin, it will be executed.
